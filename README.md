# isic_melanoma_contest_task3

Disease classification model for ISIC 2018: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection â€“ Task 3.

The original image set was modified as follows:

- added new images to AKIEC and DF
- deleted 75% of the NV images
- rotated and zoomed all of the remaining images

Augmented images as well as images with identical legion identifiers* were separated between training and validation sets to minimize data leakage.

The images were trained on the Keras VGG16, InceptionV3, and ResNet50 models. The best performing model was based on ResNet50 which is shown on the attached Jupyter Notebook.

The ResNet50 model was trained for 1 epoch / 281 seconds on a GTA 1080ti GPU, resulting in the following performance:

					Loss	  Accuracy
			Training	0.7592	  0.7234
			Validation	0.7210	  0.7381

The model achieved an average classification accuracy of 77.6% based on the ISIC contest validation data set of 193 images.

Final results for the ISIC 1,512 test images will be available when the contest concludes on 07/29/2018.
